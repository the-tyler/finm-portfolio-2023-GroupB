For instance, HML was the least important when 6 factors were together in the model. After removing CMA and RMW, HML becomes the one of the most important factors. Another example is SMB was more important than HML and very similar to UMD in 6 factors. In the 4 factors model, SMB is the least important and the difference between SMB and UMD is astronomic   "
